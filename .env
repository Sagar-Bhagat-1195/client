# Bundling Environment Variables for the Browser
# Non-NEXT_PUBLIC_ environment variables are only available in the Node.
# js environment, meaning they aren't accessible to the browser
#  (the client runs in a different environment).

# In order to make the value of an environment variable accessible in the browser, 
# Next.js can "inline" a value, at build time,
#  into the js bundle that is delivered to the client,
#   replacing all references to process.env.[variable] with a hard-coded value. 
#   To tell it to do this, you just have to prefix the variable with NEXT_PUBLIC_. For example:

# NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID=abcdefghijk


# use : This will tell Next.js to replace all references to 
# process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID in the Node.js 
# environment with the value from the environment in which you run next build,
#  allowing you to use it anywhere in your code. 
#  It will be inlined into any JavaScript sent to the browser.
